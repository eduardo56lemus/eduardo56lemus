# 👋 **Hi, I'm Eduardo Lemus**  

## 🌟 **About Me**  
I'm a student at the **University of North Carolina at Charlotte**, studying **Mathematics** with a minor in **Software Systems** and an undergraduate certificate in **Actuarial Science**. I have a strong interest in **data science**, **machine learning**, and how technology can solve real-world problems.

I’ve worked on various projects that allow me to combine my love for math with coding, and I’m always looking for ways to expand my skills, especially in **software development** and **data analysis**.

- 💻 **Languages**: I work with **Java**, **Python**, and **SQL**, and I'm currently learning **R**.
- 🌱 **Always Learning**: I’m always picking up new tools and techniques to keep growing.
- 🌍 **Languages**: I speak **English** and **Spanish**, and I know a bit of **Portuguese**.

## 🔥 **Current Projects**

### 📱 **[StudyTracker](https://github.com/eduardo56lemus/StudyTracker)**  
This is a personal project I built to track my study progress for my **actuarial exam**. I wanted something simple that helps me keep track of how many hours I need to study, how much I've done, and the time left before the exam. It’s helping me stay on track, and I’m planning to add features like dark mode soon!

### 🚗 **[Auto Claim Severity Prediction with Allstate](https://github.com/Allstate1A-BTT/Allstate1A-Studio-Project)**  
I’m working on a team project with **Allstate** to predict the severity of auto insurance claims using machine learning. We’re diving into the data to identify patterns that can help the company make better, data-informed decisions about claims. It's been a great experience to work with such a talented group.

### 🏆 **[Spring AI Studio Kaggle Project](https://github.com/Team-Beta-Carotene/Spring-AI-Studio-Kaggle-Project)**  
In this project, we’re competing in a Kaggle competition, where our goal is to build a predictive model based on real-world data. I’m excited to push my skills and see how we can perform.
